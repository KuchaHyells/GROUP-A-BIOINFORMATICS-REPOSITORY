BIOINFORMATICS GROUP A ASSIGNMENT
Bioinformatics is the application of computational methods to analyze biological data, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolic pathways. Bioinformatics emerged in the 1960s with the development of sequence analysis tools and databases1. Bioinformatics aims to understand the molecular basis of life and disease, as well as to design new drugs, vaccines, and biotechnologies. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, statistics, and engineering
