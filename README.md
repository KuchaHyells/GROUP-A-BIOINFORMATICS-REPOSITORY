# INTRODUCTION
Bioinformatics is the application of computational methods to analyze biological data, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolic pathways. Bioinformatics emerged in the 1960s with the development of sequence analysis tools and databases1. Bioinformatics aims to understand the molecular basis of life and disease, as well as to design new drugs, vaccines, and biotechnologies. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, statistics, and engineering
# SCRIPTS
SCRIPTS created also by contributors of this git repository using different programming languages that prints their names, email addresses, slack usernames and area of interest in bioinformatics are also found attached to this repository.

# Workflow
# HELP
To execute the scripts from this repository, a general script is provided that contains information on cloning the repository itself. Using git clone followed by the link to the repository allows you to clone. Upon cloning, it will provide command to change the directory from the current repository to the assignment-gsu-group-A Repository. To execute the scripts, you need to add rights to execute which can be achieved by chmod +x script. A for loop is provided that helps loop through each and every script and execute as per the commands within the loop.
